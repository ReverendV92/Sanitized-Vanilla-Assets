Various water materials that have $forcexpensive 1 set, causing them to be more expensive.

As far as I can tell so far, this entire thing is a clusterfuck and needs to be researched. I thought it was as simple as removing the command, but apparently it goes beyond the materials and into the realm of C++ code.

More investigation and editing required.
